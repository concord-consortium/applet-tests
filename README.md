applet-tests
============

This site is built with Jekyll, currently this is done by github pages when it is deployed.
Jekyll can also be run locally:

    bundle install --binstubs
    bin/jekyll serve --watch
    open http://localhost:4000/applet-tests/

Note: If you fork this repository and give it a different name you'll need to change the
`baseurl` defined in `_config.yml`.
